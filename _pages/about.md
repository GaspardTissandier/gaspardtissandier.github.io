Welcome to my website! I did my PhD in Economics at the Université Paris 1 - Panthéon Sorbonne under the supervision of Pr. Kopp. I am now holding a postdoctoral associate position at the School of Criminal Justice - Rutgers University. 

# Research topics

My research covers different subjects such as the use of statistical/ML models in criminal policies, place-based analysis of crime, as well as data-driven community action. During my PhD, I worked mostly on predictive policing, proposing public policy evaluation of existing algorithms, as well as microeconomics modeling of potential feedback loop in interaction between predictive algorithms and policymaker. 

Following my PhD defense, I joined the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University as a Postdoctoral associate, as well as the Newark Public Safety as a Research Manager. I apply my knowledge on crime modelling and place-based analysis to inform the action of the NPSC through local interventions. Our main work is to inform community based organizations with data analysis and to propose local policies based on the existing literature in social sciences and criminal justice. 

I am leading and taking part in research covering the effect of environmental design on crime outcomes at a local level, evolution of domestic violence following national policies, as well as comparative and situational studies of crime modelling algorithms for practitioners. 

You can find my research and publications on the publication pages, and my resume under the CV page. Don't hesitate to reach out by email for any questions using the *follow* button. 

# Research development

I am now starting a new research project focusing on place-based analysis of the effect of architectural styles on crime outcomes at a local level.
