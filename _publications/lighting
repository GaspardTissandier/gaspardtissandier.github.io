title: "Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced LED Street Lighting on Nighttime Crime"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'This study examines the deterrent effect of enhanced street lighting on nighttime violent crime in Newark, NJ, where high-pressure sodium lights were replaced with LED fixtures between 2019 and 2021. Using a quasi-experimental design with Difference-in-Difference setting and the 2021 Gardner estimator, we assess the impact of approximately 1,500 streetlight upgrades. Results show a significant short-term reduction in nighttime and outdoor violent crime of approximately 50% in the first two quarters post-replacement; the effect is mainly driven by a decrease in aggravated assaults and robberies. However, this effect disappears after two quarters, suggesting an adaptation to the new lighting environment. Long-term analysis doesn't show any significant reduction in violent or property crime in the long run (two years post-replacement).'
