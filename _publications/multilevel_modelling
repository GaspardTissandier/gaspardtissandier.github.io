excerpt: 'Multilevel models are statistical methods used to investigate associations between data from different levels of analysis or clusters. Given the inherent relationships between crime and its surrounding social and physical context, multilevel modeling is crucial for criminology and criminal justice research. Typically, research designs often assume observations are independent and internally homogeneous regarding the characteristics of interest. However, the social world consists of different grouping structures, where observations within the same group share more common characteristics than those in different groups. Ignoring these group-level influences can lead to incorrect analysis and interpretations. Multilevel models extend single-level regression models to account for the nested data structures. These models offer several statistical and theoretical advantages. On the one side, they avoid biased estimation of the relationships of interest. On the other side, they prevent interpretative errors, such as ecological and atomistic fallacies, and allow exploration of associations between variables measured at different levels of analysis. Various types of multilevel models exist, including: random intercept models that estimate a baseline level of the outcome of interest for each cluster of observations; random coefficient models that capture how the studied relationship varies across different groups; and fixed effect models that control for all characteristics shared by observations within the same cluster. Additionally, growth model is a specific type of multilevel model used to analyze the effects of time-related variables on an outcome measured consistently over time within the same set of observations. The choice of the most suitable multilevel model depends on statistical, methodological, and theoretical assumptions. '
