excerpt: '
R&R at International Review of Law and Economics
From late 2017 to early 2019, one of the two french law enforcement agencies (the Gendarmerie) tested in 11 out of 101 departments a predictive policing system named PAVED. The system designed by the Gendarmerie predicts burglaries and vehicle thefts with the stated objective of better allocating patrols and thus increasing deterrence. We use month-law enforcement jurisdiction area panel data to evaluate whether the system produces the expected reduction in these thefts. Using a TWFE approach and considering several alternative counterfactuals, our results consistently indicate no detectable effect of PAVED on burglaries. With regard to vehicle theft, small variations are observed following the implementation of PAVED, but these variations are not consistent or robust across the different counterfactuals considered.'
